HandBrake (https://handbrake.fr) is a free and open source tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. Emergency Brake extends HandBrake, allowing users to convert massive amounts of video with a few clicks. Emergency Brake recursively searches for a selected extension so users can convert files from a top level folder. It will also convert the media in its existing location, and optionally delete the source files after converting to maintain the current folder structure.
